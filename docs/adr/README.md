# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the Kaset project.

## What is an ADR?

An ADR is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. ADRs help:

- **Preserve context** for why decisions were made
- **Onboard new team members** faster
- **Avoid repeating discussions** about past decisions
- **Document trade-offs** considered during design

## Format

Each ADR follows this format:

```markdown
# ADR-NNNN: Title

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by ADR-XXXX]

## Context
What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision?

## Decision
What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?

## Consequences
What becomes easier or more difficult because of this change?
```
