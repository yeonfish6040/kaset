## Overview

The YouTube Music API (`youtubei/v1`) is an internal API used by the YouTube Music web client. Key characteristics:

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Base URL | `https://music.youtube.com/youtubei/v1` |
| API Key | `AIzaSyC9XL3ZjWddXya6X74dJoCTL-WEYFDNX30` |
| Client Name | `WEB_REMIX` |
| Client Version | `1.20231204.01.00` |
| Protocol | HTTPS POST with JSON body |

### Endpoint Types

1. **Browse Endpoints** - Load content pages (Home, Explore, Library, etc.)
2. **Action Endpoints** - Perform operations (Search, Like, Subscribe, etc.)

---

## Authentication

### Authentication Methods

| Method | Description | Required For |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| **API Key Only** | Append `?key=...` to URL | Public endpoints (Charts, Player) |
| **SAPISIDHASH** | Cookie-based auth header | User library, ratings, subscriptions |

### SAPISIDHASH Generation

```swift
let origin = "https://music.youtube.com"
let timestamp = Int(Date().timeIntervalSince1970)
let hashInput = "\(timestamp) \(sapisid) \(origin)"
let hash = SHA1(hashInput)
let header = "SAPISIDHASH \(timestamp)_\(hash)"
```

### Required Cookies

| Cookie | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `SAPISID` | Used in SAPISIDHASH calculation |
| `__Secure-3PAPISID` | Fallback for SAPISID |
| `SID`, `HSID`, `SSID` | Session cookies |
| `LOGIN_INFO` | Login state |

### Brand Account Support

Brand accounts (YouTube channels) can be accessed by setting `context.user.onBehalfOfUser` in the request body. This is separate from the `X-Goog-AuthUser` header, which only switches between multiple Google accounts.

#### Discovering Brand Accounts

Use the `account/accounts_list` endpoint to get all accounts (primary + brand) with their IDs:

```bash
./Tools/api-explorer.swift brandaccounts
```

**Response Structure**:
```
📧 Google Account: user@gmail.com

📋 Found 2 account(s):

  0: Primary Account (@handle) [Primary] ← current
  1: Brand Channel (@brand-handle) [Brand Account]
     Brand ID: 111997145576882617490
```

**API Response Path**:
```
actions[0].getMultiPageMenuAction.menu.multiPageMenuRenderer.sections[0]
  .accountSectionListRenderer.contents[0].accountItemSectionRenderer.contents[]
```

Each brand account item contains:
- `accountName.runs[0].text` — Display name
- `channelHandle.runs[0].text` — @handle
- `serviceEndpoint.selectActiveIdentityEndpoint.supportedTokens[].pageIdToken.pageId` — Brand account ID (21-digit string)

#### Using Brand Accounts

Add the brand ID to the request body context:

```swift
let body: [String: Any] = [
    "context": [
        "client": [
            "clientName": "WEB_REMIX",
            "clientVersion": "1.20231204.01.00"
        ],
        "user": [
            "onBehalfOfUser": "111997145576882617490"  // Brand account ID
        ]
    ],
    "browseId": "FEmusic_liked_playlists"
]
```

**API Explorer Usage**:
```bash
# List brand accounts with IDs
./Tools/api-explorer.swift brandaccounts

# Access brand account library
./Tools/api-explorer.swift browse FEmusic_liked_playlists --brand 111997145576882617490
```

#### Key Differences: authuser vs brand

| Mechanism | Header/Body | Purpose | ID Format |
|-----------|-------------|---------|-----------|
| `X-Goog-AuthUser: N` | Header | Switch between multiple Google accounts logged in | Integer index (0, 1, 2...) |
| `context.user.onBehalfOfUser` | Body | Access brand account under same Google account | 21-digit string |

> **Note**: Brand accounts are YouTube channels created under a Google account. They share the same authentication cookies but have separate libraries. The brand ID can also be found at `https://myaccount.google.com/brandaccounts` after selecting the account (appears in URL as `/b/21_digit_number`).

---

## Browse Endpoints

Browse endpoints use `POST /browse` with a `browseId` parameter.

### Implemented Browse Endpoints

| Browse ID | Name | Auth | Description | Parser |
|-----------|------|------|-------------|--------|
| `FEmusic_home` | Home | 🌐 | Personalized recommendations, mixes, quick picks | `HomeResponseParser` |
| `FEmusic_explore` | Explore | 🌐 | New releases, charts, moods shortcuts | `HomeResponseParser` |
| `FEmusic_charts` | Charts | 🌐 | Top songs, albums by country/genre | `HomeResponseParser` |
| `FEmusic_moods_and_genres` | Moods & Genres | 🌐 | Browse by mood/genre grids | `HomeResponseParser` |
| `FEmusic_new_releases` | New Releases | 🌐 | Recent albums, singles, videos | `HomeResponseParser` |
| `FEmusic_library_landing` | Library Landing | 🔐 | All library content (playlists, podcasts, artists) | `PlaylistParser.parseLibraryContent` |
| `FEmusic_liked_playlists` | Library Playlists | 🔐 | User's saved/created playlists | `PlaylistParser` |
| `FEmusic_library_privately_owned_tracks` | Uploaded Songs | 🔐 | User-uploaded songs with playlist-style rows and continuation | `PlaylistParser` |
| `VLLM` | Liked Songs | 🔐 | All songs user has liked (with pagination) | `PlaylistParser` |
| `VL{playlistId}` | Playlist Detail | 🌐 | Playlist tracks and metadata | `PlaylistParser` |
| `UC{channelId}` | Artist Detail | 🌐 | Artist page with songs, albums | `ArtistParser` |
| `MPLYt{id}` | Lyrics | 🌐 | Song lyrics text | `LyricsParser` |
| `FEmusic_podcasts` | Podcasts Discovery | 🌐 | Podcast shows and episodes carousel | `PodcastParser` |
| `MPSPP{id}` | Podcast Show Detail | 🌐 | Podcast episodes with playback progress | `PodcastParser` |

> **Note**: Charts, Moods & Genres, and New Releases all use `HomeResponseParser` since they share the same section-based response structure. `VLLM` is a special case of `VL{playlistId}` where `LM` is the Liked Music playlist ID. Do NOT use `FEmusic_liked_videos` — it returns only ~13 songs without pagination.

#### Home (`FEmusic_home`)

```swift
// Request
let body = ["browseId": "FEmusic_home"]

// Response structure
{
  "contents": {
    "singleColumnBrowseResultsRenderer": {
      "tabs": [{
        "tabRenderer": {
          "content": {
            "sectionListRenderer": {
              "contents": [/* sections */],
              "continuations": [/* for pagination */]
            }
          }
        }
      }]
    }
  }
}
```

**Sections types**: `musicCarouselShelfRenderer`, `musicImmersiveCarouselShelfRenderer`, `gridRenderer`

**Continuation**: Supports progressive loading via `getHomeContinuation()`

---

#### Explore (`FEmusic_explore`)

```swift
let body = ["browseId": "FEmusic_explore"]
```

**Sections**: New releases carousel, Charts shortcut, Moods & Genres shortcut, personalized recommendations

---

#### Library Playlists (`FEmusic_liked_playlists`)

```swift
let body = ["browseId": "FEmusic_liked_playlists"]
// Requires authentication
```

**Returns**: List of user's playlists with metadata (title, track count, thumbnail)

---

#### Liked Songs (`VLLM`)

> ⚠️ **Use `VLLM`, not `FEmusic_liked_videos`** — The `FEmusic_liked_videos` browse ID returns only ~13 songs with NO continuation token. To fetch all liked songs, use `VLLM` (VL prefix + LM playlist ID) which returns the full list with proper pagination.

```swift
// ✅ Correct: Use VLLM for all liked songs
let body = ["browseId": "VLLM"]
// Requires authentication

// ❌ Avoid: FEmusic_liked_videos is limited to ~13 songs
// let body = ["browseId": "FEmusic_liked_videos"]
```

**Returns**: Playlist-format response with all liked songs and continuation token for pagination

**Parser**: Uses `PlaylistParser.parsePlaylistWithContinuation()` (same as regular playlists)

---

### Available Browse Endpoints

These endpoints are functional but not yet implemented in Kaset.

| Browse ID | Name | Auth | Priority | Notes |
|-----------|------|------|----------|-------|
| `FEmusic_history` | History | 🔐 | **High** | Recently played tracks |
| `FEmusic_library_non_music_audio_list` | Subscribed Podcasts | 🔐 | Medium | User's subscribed podcast shows |
| `FEmusic_library_albums` | Library Albums | 🔐 | Medium | Requires auth + params* |
| `FEmusic_library_corpus_track_artists` | Library Artists (Artists chip) | 🔐 | Medium | Sign-in backed; returns `MPLAUC...` library artist pages |
| `FEmusic_library_artists` | Library Artists (param-based) | 🔐 | Medium | Requires auth + params*; distinct from the Artists chip |
| `FEmusic_library_songs` | Library Songs | 🔐 | Low | Requires auth + params* |
| `FEmusic_recently_played` | Recently Played | 🔐 | Medium | Requires auth |
| `FEmusic_library_privately_owned_landing` | Uploads | 🔐 | Low | User-uploaded content |
| `FEmusic_library_privately_owned_albums` | Uploaded Albums | 🔐 | Low | Uploaded albums |

> `FEmusic_library_corpus_track_artists` is the browseId behind the Library landing Artists chip. With authentication it returns `musicResponsiveListItemRenderer` rows whose `browseId` values look like `MPLAUC...` and use `pageType = MUSIC_PAGE_TYPE_LIBRARY_ARTIST`. Without authentication it still returns HTTP 200, but only with a sign-in prompt.
>
> \* `FEmusic_library_albums`, `FEmusic_library_artists`, and `FEmusic_library_songs` are separate param-based library endpoints. They return HTTP 400 without authentication and the correct `params` value.

#### Uploaded Songs (`FEmusic_library_privately_owned_tracks`)

```swift
let body = ["browseId": "FEmusic_library_privately_owned_tracks"]
// Requires authentication for user content
```

**Returns**: Playlist/list-style uploaded song rows with continuation for large upload libraries.

**Parser**: Uses `PlaylistParser.parsePlaylistWithContinuation()` for the detail page and `PlaylistParser.parseUploadedSongsPlaylist()` for the Library tile. Uploaded rows may include artist metadata as plain text without a browse endpoint, so `ParsingHelpers.extractArtistsFromFlexColumns()` preserves plain artist text when no linked artist run is present.

**Unauthenticated behavior verified on May 2, 2026**: HTTP 200 with a sign-in `messageRenderer` and no track rows.

---

#### Library Landing (`FEmusic_library_landing`)

```swift
let body = ["browseId": "FEmusic_library_landing"]
// Requires authentication
```

**Response structure**:
- Returns all library content in a single `gridRenderer`
- Includes: Playlists (`VL*`), Podcasts (`MPSPP*`), artist/profile tiles (`UC*`), Profiles, Auto playlists
- Contains filter chips for: Playlists, Podcasts, Songs, Albums, Artists, Profiles
- Each chip's `browseEndpoint.browseId` provides the filtered endpoint
- The landing grid may expose artist tiles as `UC*`, but the filtered Artists chip returns library-artist browse IDs instead

**Filter chip endpoints discovered**:
| Chip | browseId |
|------|----------|
| Playlists | `FEmusic_liked_playlists` |
| Podcasts | `FEmusic_library_non_music_audio_list` |
| Songs | `FEmusic_liked_videos` |
| Albums | `FEmusic_liked_albums` |
| Artists | `FEmusic_library_corpus_track_artists` |
| Profiles | `FEmusic_library_user_profile_channels_list` (with params) |

**Artists chip behavior**:
- `FEmusic_library_corpus_track_artists` returns a `sectionListRenderer` of `musicResponsiveListItemRenderer` rows
- Signed-in artist rows navigate to `browseEndpoint.browseId = MPLAUC...`
- Those browse IDs use `pageType = MUSIC_PAGE_TYPE_LIBRARY_ARTIST`
- Without authentication, the same endpoint responds with HTTP 200 and a sign-in prompt instead of artist rows

**Item identification by browseId prefix**:
- `VL*`, `PL*`, `RDCLAK*` — Playlists
- `MPSPP*` — Podcast shows (see [Podcast ID Format](#podcast-id-format) below)
- `UC*` — Artists or Profiles
- `MPLAUC*` — Library artist pages returned by the Artists chip (direct browse requires auth)
- `VLLM` — Liked Music auto playlist
- `VLRDPN` — New Episodes auto playlist
- `VLSE` — Episodes for Later auto playlist

#### Podcast ID Format

Podcast show IDs follow a specific structure that requires conversion for subscription operations:

| ID Type | Format | Example |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Show Browse ID | `MPSPP` + `L` + `{base64suffix}` | `MPSPPLXz2p9abc123def` |
| Playlist ID (for API) | `PL` + `{base64suffix}` | `PLXz2p9abc123def` |

**Conversion Logic**:
```swift
// MPSPP IDs are structured as: "MPSPP" + "L" + {idSuffix}
// To convert to playlist ID: strip "MPSPP" (5 chars), prepend "P"
let suffix = String(showId.dropFirst(5))  // "LXz2p9abc123def"
let playlistId = "P" + suffix              // "PLXz2p9abc123def"
```

> ⚠️ **Critical**: The suffix already starts with `L`. Adding `"PL"` instead of `"P"` creates a double-L (`PLLXz2p9...`) which causes HTTP 404 errors. Always use `"P" + suffix`, never `"PL" + suffix`.

**Validation Requirements** (implemented in `YTMusicClient.convertPodcastShowIdToPlaylistId`):
1. ID must have `MPSPP` prefix (warns and passes through if missing)
2. Suffix after stripping `MPSPP` must not be empty (throws)
3. Suffix must start with `L` (throws)

---

#### Charts (`FEmusic_charts`)

```swift
let body = ["browseId": "FEmusic_charts"]
```

**Response structure**:
- Top songs chart (ranked list)
- Top albums chart
- Trending videos
- Genre-specific charts
- Country-specific charts (via params)

**Implementation suggestion**:
```swift
func getCharts(country: String? = nil) async throws -> ChartsResponse
```

---

#### Moods & Genres (`FEmusic_moods_and_genres`)

```swift
let body = ["browseId": "FEmusic_moods_and_genres"]
```

**Response structure**:
- Grid of moods (Chill, Focus, Workout, Party, etc.)
- Grid of genres (Pop, Rock, Hip-Hop, R&B, etc.)

Each item links to a playlist or browse endpoint for that mood/genre.

---

#### History (`FEmusic_history`)

```swift
let body = ["browseId": "FEmusic_history"]
// Requires authentication
```

**Response structure**:
- Sections organized by time (Today, Yesterday, This Week, etc.)
- Each section contains recently played tracks

---

#### New Releases (`FEmusic_new_releases`)

```swift
let body = ["browseId": "FEmusic_new_releases"]
```

**Response structure**:
- New albums grid
- New singles
- New music videos

---

## Action Endpoints

Action endpoints perform operations or fetch specific data.

### Implemented Action Endpoints

| Endpoint | Name | Auth | Description |
|----------|------|------|-------------|
| `search` | Search | 🌐 | Search songs, albums, artists, playlists |
| `music/get_search_suggestions` | Suggestions | 🌐 | Autocomplete for search |
| `next` | Now Playing | 🌐 | Track info, lyrics ID, radio queue |
| `like/like` | Like | 🔐 | Like a song/album/playlist |
| `like/dislike` | Dislike | 🔐 | Dislike a song |
| `like/removelike` | Remove Like | 🔐 | Remove like/dislike rating |
| `feedback` | Feedback | 🔐 | Add/remove from library via tokens |
| `subscription/subscribe` | Subscribe | 🔐 | Subscribe to artist |
| `subscription/unsubscribe` | Unsubscribe | 🔐 | Unsubscribe from artist |
| `account/accounts_list` | Accounts List | 🔐 | List all accounts (primary + brand) |
| `account/account_menu` | Account Menu | 🔐 | Current account info and settings |

---

#### Search (`search`)

```swift
let body = ["query": "never gonna give you up"]
```

**Response Structure**:
- `musicCardShelfRenderer` — **Top Result** section (single prominent result: song, album, artist, or playlist)
- `musicShelfRenderer` — Regular results (mixed songs, albums, artists, playlists)

> ⚠️ **Important**: The Top Result (most relevant match) is returned in `musicCardShelfRenderer`, not `musicShelfRenderer`. This is often the artist/album the user is looking for. Always parse both renderer types.

**Top Result Example** (searching "manifest"):
```json
{
  "musicCardShelfRenderer": {
    "title": {
      "runs": [{
        "text": "manifest",
        "navigationEndpoint": {
          "browseEndpoint": {
            "browseId": "UCavTTSUSD6aYPeF-F3ND9Yg",
            "browseEndpointContextSupportedConfigs": {
              "browseEndpointContextMusicConfig": {
                "pageType": "MUSIC_PAGE_TYPE_ARTIST"
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }]
    },
    "subtitle": { "runs": [{ "text": "Artist • 19.1M monthly audience" }] },
    "thumbnail": { ... },
    "contents": [ /* related songs/albums */ ]
  }
}
```

**Parser**: `SearchResponseParser` (handles both `musicCardShelfRenderer` and `musicShelfRenderer`)

**Filter Params** (base64-encoded filter values for `params` field):

| Filter | Param Value | Description |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Songs | `EgWKAQIIAWoMEA4QChADEAQQCRAF` | Filter to songs only |
| Albums | `EgWKAQIYAWoMEA4QChADEAQQCRAF` | Filter to albums only |
| Artists | `EgWKAQIgAWoMEA4QChADEAQQCRAF` | Filter to artists only |
| Playlists | `EgWKAQIoAWoMEA4QChADEAQQCRAF` | Filter to all playlists |
| Featured Playlists | `EgeKAQQoADgBagwQDhAKEAMQBBAJEAU=` | YouTube Music curated playlists |
| Community Playlists | `EgeKAQQoAEABagwQDhAKEAMQBBAJEAU=` | User-created playlists |
| Podcasts | `EgWKAQJQAWoQEBAQCRAEEAMQBRAKEBUQEQ%3D%3D` | Filter to podcast shows only |

> **Filter Pattern**: `EgWKAQ` (base) + filter code + `AWoMEA4QChADEAQQCRAF` (no spelling correction suffix). The filter code encodes the content type (songs=II, albums=IY, artists=Ig, playlists=Io, podcasts=JQ).

**Usage Example** (podcasts):
```swift
let body: [String: Any] = [
    "query": "crime weekly",
    "params": "EgWKAQJQAWoQEBAQCRAEEAMQBRAKEBUQEQ%3D%3D"
]
```

---

#### Search Suggestions (`music/get_search_suggestions`)

```swift
let body = ["input": "never gon"]
```

**Response**: Array of suggestion strings and search history.

**Parser**: `SearchSuggestionsParser`

---

#### Next / Now Playing (`next`)

```swift
let body: [String: Any] = [
    "videoId": "dQw4w9WgXcQ",
    "enablePersistentPlaylistPanel": true,
    "isAudioOnly": true,
    "tunerSettingValue": "AUTOMIX_SETTING_NORMAL"
]
```

**Response contains**:
- Current track metadata
- Lyrics browse ID (in tabs)
- Related tracks / autoplay queue
- Feedback tokens for library actions
- Continuation token for infinite mix (in `playlistPanelRenderer.continuations`)

**Used for**:
- `getLyrics(videoId:)` - Extracts lyrics browse ID
- `getSong(videoId:)` - Gets full song metadata with tokens
- `getRadioQueue(videoId:)` - Gets radio mix (with `playlistId: "RDAMVM{videoId}"`)
- `getMixQueue(playlistId:)` - Gets artist mix (with `playlistId: "RDEM..."`)

**Continuation (Infinite Mix)**:

For mix playlists, the response includes a continuation token at:
```
playlistPanelRenderer.continuations[0].nextRadioContinuationData.continuation
```

To fetch more songs:
```swift
let body: [String: Any] = [
    "continuation": token,
    "enablePersistentPlaylistPanel": true,
    "isAudioOnly": true
]
_ = try await request("next", body: body)
```

Response structure: `continuationContents.playlistPanelContinuation.contents`

---

#### Like/Dislike (`like/*`)

```swift
// Like a song
let body = ["target": ["videoId": "dQw4w9WgXcQ"]]
_ = try await request("like/like", body: body)

// Like a playlist
let body = ["target": ["playlistId": "PLxyz..."]]
_ = try await request("like/like", body: body)

// Remove like
_ = try await request("like/removelike", body: body)
```

---

#### Feedback (Library Management)

```swift
// Add to library using token from song metadata
let body = ["feedbackTokens": [addToken]]
_ = try await request("feedback", body: body)
```

Tokens come from `getSong(videoId:)` response.

---

#### Subscribe/Unsubscribe

**Artist Subscription** (uses channel ID):
```swift
let body = ["channelIds": ["UCuAXFkgsw1L7xaCfnd5JJOw"]]
_ = try await request("subscription/subscribe", body: body)
```

**Podcast Subscription** (uses like/like endpoint with converted playlist ID):
```swift
// Podcast show IDs have MPSPP prefix (e.g., "MPSPPLXz2p9...")
// The suffix after MPSPP already starts with "L", so:
// - Strip "MPSPP" (5 chars) to get "LXz2p9..."  
// - Prepend "P" to get "PLXz2p9..."
//
// ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Do NOT add "PL" prefix - that would create "PLLXz2p9..." which returns 404!

// Subscribe to podcast (add to library)
let suffix = String(showId.dropFirst(5)) // Drop "MPSPP"
let playlistId = "P" + suffix            // Prepend "P" only
let body = ["target": ["playlistId": playlistId]]
_ = try await request("like/like", body: body)

// Unsubscribe from podcast (remove from library)
let body = ["target": ["playlistId": playlistId]]
_ = try await request("like/removelike", body: body)
```

> ⚠️ **Note**: Podcast subscription uses `like/like` and `like/removelike` endpoints, NOT `subscription/*`. The MPSPP browse ID must be converted to a PL playlist ID by stripping "MPSPP" and prepending "P" (not "PL").

---

> rather than a direct `playlistPanelVideoRenderer`. Parsers must handle this wrapper.

- `title`, `longBylineText`, `thumbnail`, `lengthText`
- `selected`, `navigationEndpoint`, `videoId`, `shortBylineText`
- `trackingParams`, `menu`

**Use cases**:
- Get metadata for multiple videos in one call (queue display)
- **Fetch ALL tracks for radio playlists** (RDCLAK prefix) where browse pagination is broken

#### Playlist Management

All playlist management endpoints require authentication (HTTP 401 without auth). The app exposes these through `YTMusicClientProtocol` so context menus and view models can be tested with mocks.

##### Add-to-Playlist Menu (`playlist/get_add_to_playlist`)

```swift
let body: [String: Any] = [
    "videoIds": ["dQw4w9WgXcQ"],
]
let response = try await request("playlist/get_add_to_playlist", body: body, ttl: APICache.TTL.library)
let menu = PlaylistParser.parseAddToPlaylistMenu(response)
```

Parser notes:
- The useful payload is usually under `addToPlaylistRenderer`; parser falls back to the root dictionary if that wrapper is absent.
- Playlist options are only read from known option renderer wrappers: `playlistAddToOptionRenderer`, `addToPlaylistItemRenderer`, `musicResponsiveListItemRenderer`, and `musicTwoRowItemRenderer`. Do not treat arbitrary parent containers as options just because they contain a nested `playlistId`.
- Options are deduplicated by `playlistId` and expose title, subtitle, thumbnail, selected/checked state, and optional privacy status.
- `canCreatePlaylist` is true only when the renderer contains `createPlaylistEndpoint`; do not infer create support from display text containing "Create".
- The submenu disables already-selected playlists and only shows "Create Playlist…" when `canCreatePlaylist` is true.

Representative shape:

```json
{
  "addToPlaylistRenderer": {
    "title": { "runs": [{ "text": "Add to playlist" }] },
    "contents": [
      {
        "playlistAddToOptionRenderer": {
          "title": { "runs": [{ "text": "Road Trip" }] },
          "subtitle": { "runs": [{ "text": "Private" }] },
          "selected": true,
          "serviceEndpoint": {
            "playlistEditEndpoint": { "playlistId": "PLROADTRIP" }
          }
        }
      }
    ],
    "createPlaylistEndpoint": {}
  }
}
```

##### Add Song to Playlist (`browse/edit_playlist`)

```swift
let cleanPlaylistId = playlistId.hasPrefix("VL") ? String(playlistId.dropFirst(2)) : playlistId
let body: [String: Any] = [
    "playlistId": cleanPlaylistId,
    "actions": [[
        "action": "ACTION_ADD_VIDEO",
        "addedVideoId": "dQw4w9WgXcQ",
    ]],
]
try await request("browse/edit_playlist", body: body)
```

Implementation notes:
- Strip a leading `VL` from playlist browse IDs before sending mutation requests.
- The `allowDuplicate` client parameter is reserved for future UI; YouTube Music currently handles duplicate behavior server-side.
- Successful mutations call `APICache.invalidateMutationCaches()`, which clears `browse:`, `next:`, `like:`, and `playlist/get_add_to_playlist:` entries so library views, metadata, and add-to-playlist menus refresh.

##### Create Playlist (`playlist/create`)

```swift
var body: [String: Any] = [
    "title": "My Playlist",
    "privacyStatus": PlaylistPrivacyStatus.private.rawValue, // PRIVATE, UNLISTED, PUBLIC
]
body["description"] = "Optional description" // omit when blank
body["videoIds"] = ["dQw4w9WgXcQ"]        // omit when empty

let response = try await request("playlist/create", body: body)
let playlistId = PlaylistParser.parseCreatedPlaylistId(response)
```

Parser notes:
- Prefer a non-empty top-level `playlistId`.
- Fall back to known nested response shapes such as toast `notificationTextRenderer.navigationEndpoint.browseEndpoint.playlistId`, action navigation endpoints, or `command.browseEndpoint.playlistId`.
- If no playlist ID can be found, throw a parse error rather than assuming creation succeeded.

Representative response shapes observed by tests:

```json
{ "playlistId": "PLCREATED123", "status": "STATUS_SUCCEEDED" }
```

```json
{
  "actions": [
    {
      "addToToastAction": {
        "item": {
          "notificationTextRenderer": {
            "responseText": { "runs": [{ "text": "Playlist created" }] },
            "navigationEndpoint": {
              "browseEndpoint": { "playlistId": "PLNESTED456" }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

##### Delete Playlist (`playlist/delete`)

```swift
let cleanPlaylistId = playlistId.hasPrefix("VL") ? String(playlistId.dropFirst(2)) : playlistId
try await request("playlist/delete", body: ["playlistId": cleanPlaylistId])
```

Implementation notes:
- Only expose destructive delete UI when parsed playlist data indicates the signed-in user can delete it.
- `Playlist.canDelete` / `PlaylistDetail.canDelete` is derived from payload affordances such as `deletePlaylistEndpoint`, `musicEditablePlaylistDetailHeaderRenderer`, or `playlist/delete` command text; unknown ownership defaults to false.
- Delete mutations also invalidate mutation-affected app caches.

## Request Patterns

### Standard Request Structure

```swift
// URL
POST https://music.youtube.com/youtubei/v1/{endpoint}?key={apiKey}&prettyPrint=false

// Headers
Content-Type: application/json
Cookie: {cookies}
Authorization: SAPISIDHASH {timestamp}_{hash}
Origin: https://music.youtube.com
X-Goog-AuthUser: 0

// Body
{
  "context": {
    "client": {
      "clientName": "WEB_REMIX",
      "clientVersion": "1.20231204.01.00",
      "hl": "en",
      "gl": "US"
    }
  },
  // ... endpoint-specific params
}
```

### Continuation Pattern

For paginated content:

```swift
// First request
let body = ["browseId": "FEmusic_home"]
let response = try await request("browse", body: body)
let token = extractContinuationToken(response)

// Continuation request
let body = ["continuation": token]
let more = try await request("browse", body: body)
```

---

## Response Parsing

### Common Renderer Types

| Renderer | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `musicCarouselShelfRenderer` | Horizontal scrolling shelf |
| `musicImmersiveCarouselShelfRenderer` | Hero carousel |
| `musicCardShelfRenderer` | **Top Result** in search (single prominent item with related content) |
| `gridRenderer` | Grid of items |
| `musicShelfRenderer` | Vertical list (search results, artist songs) |
| `musicTwoRowItemRenderer` | Album/playlist card |
| `musicResponsiveListItemRenderer` | Song row |
| `playlistPanelVideoRenderer` | Queue/playlist item |

### Navigation Extraction

```swift
// Extract browse ID from item
if let navEndpoint = item["navigationEndpoint"] as? [String: Any],
   let browseEndpoint = navEndpoint["browseEndpoint"] as? [String: Any],
   let browseId = browseEndpoint["browseId"] as? String {
    // Use browseId
}

// Extract video ID
if let watchEndpoint = navEndpoint["watchEndpoint"] as? [String: Any],
   let videoId = watchEndpoint["videoId"] as? String {
    // Use videoId
}
```

---

## Parsers Reference

All parsers are located in `Sources/Kaset/Services/API/Parsers/`. Each parser is responsible for extracting structured data from raw API JSON responses.

| Parser | File | Input | Output | Used By |
|--------|------|-------|--------|--------|
| `HomeResponseParser` | `HomeResponseParser.swift` | Home/Explore browse response | `HomeResponse` with `[HomeSection]` | `FEmusic_home`, `FEmusic_explore` |
| `SearchResponseParser` | `SearchResponseParser.swift` | Search response | `SearchResponse` with songs, albums, artists, playlists | `search` endpoint |
| `SearchSuggestionsParser` | `SearchSuggestionsParser.swift` | Suggestions response | `[SearchSuggestion]` | `music/get_search_suggestions` |
| `PlaylistParser` | `PlaylistParser.swift` | Playlist/library response | `[Playlist]`, `LibraryContent` | `VL{id}`, `VLLM`, `FEmusic_liked_playlists`, `FEmusic_library_landing` |
| `ArtistParser` | `ArtistParser.swift` | Artist browse response | `ArtistDetail` with songs, albums | `UC{channelId}` |
| `LyricsParser` | `LyricsParser.swift` | Next/lyrics response | `Lyrics` or lyrics browse ID | `next`, `MPLYt{id}` |
| `PodcastParser` | `PodcastParser.swift` | Podcast browse response | `[PodcastSection]`, `PodcastShowDetail` | `FEmusic_podcasts`, `MPSPP{id}` |
| `AccountsListParser` | `AccountsListParser.swift` | Accounts list response | `AccountsListResponse` with `[UserAccount]` | `account/accounts_list` |
| `SongMetadataParser` | `SongMetadataParser.swift` | Next endpoint response | `Song` with full metadata | `next` endpoint |
| `RadioQueueParser` | `RadioQueueParser.swift` | Next endpoint response | `RadioQueueResult` with songs + continuation | Radio/mix playback |
| `ParsingHelpers` | `ParsingHelpers.swift` | Various | Utility functions (stable IDs, text extraction) | All parsers |

### Parser Patterns

**Common extraction helpers** (from `ParsingHelpers`):

```swift
// Extract text from runs array
ParsingHelpers.extractText(from: titleRuns)  // -> "Song Title"

// Generate stable ID for SwiftUI
ParsingHelpers.stableId(title: "Section", components: "item1")  // -> deterministic hash

// Extract thumbnail URL with size preference
ParsingHelpers.extractThumbnailURL(from: thumbnails, preferredSize: 226)
```

**Common response structure**:
```
contents
  -> singleColumnBrowseResultsRenderer
    -> tabs[0]
      -> tabRenderer
        -> content
          -> sectionListRenderer
            -> contents[]  <- iterate here for sections
```

## Error Handling

Kaset uses a unified `YTMusicError` enum for all API-related errors. This enables consistent error handling, user-friendly messages, and retry logic.

### Error Types

| Error | When Thrown | Retryable | User Action |
|-------|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `authExpired` | HTTP 401/403, invalid SAPISIDHASH | ❌ | Sign in again |
| `notAuthenticated` | No cookies available for auth-required endpoint | ❌ | Sign in |
| `networkError(underlying:)` | Connection failed, timeout, DNS failure | ✅ | Check connection |
| `parseError(message:)` | Unexpected JSON structure, missing required fields | ❌ | Report bug |
| `apiError(message:, code:)` | API returned error response | ✅ (5xx only) | Try again |
| `playbackError(message:)` | WebView playback failed, DRM error | ✅ | Try different track |
| `invalidInput(message:)` | Invalid video ID, empty query | ❌ | Fix input |
| `unknown(message:)` | Catch-all for unexpected errors | ✅ | Try again |

### Error Properties

```swift
let error: YTMusicError = .networkError(underlying: urlError)

error.errorDescription     // "Network error: The Internet connection appears to be offline."
error.recoverySuggestion   // "Check your internet connection and try again."
error.userFriendlyTitle    // "Connection Error"
error.userFriendlyMessage  // "Unable to connect. Please check your internet connection."
error.requiresReauth       // false
error.isRetryable          // true
```

### Handling in Views

```swift
// In ViewModel
func load() async {
    do {
        self.data = try await client.fetchData()
    } catch let error as YTMusicError {
        if error.requiresReauth {
            self.showLoginSheet = true
        } else if error.isRetryable {
            self.errorMessage = error.userFriendlyMessage
            self.showRetryButton = true
        } else {
            self.errorMessage = error.userFriendlyMessage
        }
    }
}
```

### Retry Logic

Use `RetryPolicy` for automatic retries with exponential backoff:

```swift
let result = try await RetryPolicy.execute(
    maxAttempts: 3,
    initialDelay: .seconds(1),
    shouldRetry: { error in
        (error as? YTMusicError)?.isRetryable ?? false
    }
) {
    try await client.fetchData()
}
```

## Using the API Explorer

The standalone [api-explorer.swift](../Tools/api-explorer.swift) tool provides comprehensive exploration of both public and authenticated API endpoints.

### Setup

```bash
# Make executable (one time)
chmod +x Tools/api-explorer.swift
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Check authentication status
./Tools/api-explorer.swift auth

# List all known endpoints
./Tools/api-explorer.swift list

# Explore a public browse endpoint
./Tools/api-explorer.swift browse FEmusic_charts
# Output: ✅ HTTP 200
#         📋 Top-level keys (5): contents, frameworkUpdates, header...

# Explore with verbose output (shows full raw JSON, no truncation)
./Tools/api-explorer.swift browse FEmusic_home -v

# Save raw JSON to a file for analysis
./Tools/api-explorer.swift action search '{"query":"manifest"}' -o /tmp/search.json

# Explore action endpoints
./Tools/api-explorer.swift action search '{"query":"never gonna give you up"}'
./Tools/api-explorer.swift action player '{"videoId":"dQw4w9WgXcQ"}'
```

### Authenticated Endpoints

For authenticated endpoints (🔐), sign in to the Kaset app first:

```bash
# Check if cookies are available
./Tools/api-explorer.swift auth

# If authenticated, explore library endpoints
./Tools/api-explorer.swift browse FEmusic_liked_playlists
./Tools/api-explorer.swift browse FEmusic_history
./Tools/api-explorer.swift browse FEmusic_library_albums ggMGKgQIARAA
```

Debug builds export auth cookies for the API explorer to `~/Library/Application Support/Kaset/cookies.dat`.

### Brand Account Support

```bash
# List all accounts (primary + brand) with their IDs
./Tools/api-explorer.swift brandaccounts

# Access a brand account's library
./Tools/api-explorer.swift browse FEmusic_liked_playlists --brand 111997145576882617490
```

The `--brand` flag sets `context.user.onBehalfOfUser` in the request body. See [Brand Account Support](#brand-account-support) in the Authentication section for details.

### Commands Reference

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `browse <id> [params]` | Explore a browse endpoint |

## Video Feature API

This section documents API functionality for the floating video window feature. See [docs/video.md](video.md) for implementation details.

### Music Video Type Detection

The `musicVideoType` field distinguishes between actual music videos and audio-only tracks. This is available in both `player` and `next` endpoint responses.

| Video Type | Constant | Description | Has Video Content |
|------------|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Official Music Video | `MUSIC_VIDEO_TYPE_OMV` | Full video from artist/label | ✅ Yes |
| Audio Track Video | `MUSIC_VIDEO_TYPE_ATV` | Static image or visualizer | ❌ No |
| User Generated Content | `MUSIC_VIDEO_TYPE_UGC` | Fan-made or unofficial | ⚠️ Varies |
| Podcast Episode | `MUSIC_VIDEO_TYPE_PODCAST_EPISODE` | Audio podcast | ❌ No |

**Implementation**: The `MusicVideoType` enum and parsing are implemented in:
- [Sources/Kaset/Models/MusicVideoType.swift](../Sources/Kaset/Models/MusicVideoType.swift) - Enum definition
- [Sources/Kaset/Models/Song.swift](../Sources/Kaset/Models/Song.swift) - `musicVideoType` property
- [Sources/Kaset/Services/API/Parsers/SongMetadataParser.swift](../Sources/Kaset/Services/API/Parsers/SongMetadataParser.swift) - Parsing logic

**Location in `next` response**:
```
playlistPanelVideoRenderer.navigationEndpoint.watchEndpoint
  .watchEndpointMusicSupportedConfigs.watchEndpointMusicConfig.musicVideoType
```

**Location in `player` response**:
```
videoDetails.musicVideoType
```

**Usage Example**:
```swift
// Only show video toggle for actual music videos
if song.musicVideoType?.hasVideoContent == true {
    showVideoToggle()
}
```

---

### Video Quality Options (Future Enhancement)

The `player` endpoint returns video streaming data in `streamingData.adaptiveFormats`. This could enable a video quality selector feature.

> ⚠️ **Not Implemented**: Due to DRM requirements, Kaset uses WebView for playback. Direct URL streaming would bypass DRM protection. Quality selection would need to be implemented via WebView JavaScript.

**Available Qualities** (from `adaptiveFormats`):

| Quality | Resolution | Codec Options |
|---------|------------|---------------|
| 1080p | 1920×1080 | H.264 (avc1.640028), VP9 |
| 720p | 1280×720 | H.264 (avc1.4d401f), VP9 |
| 480p | 854×480 | H.264 (avc1.4d401f), VP9 |
| 360p | 640×360 | H.264 (avc1.4d401e), VP9 |
| 240p | 426×240 | H.264 (avc1.4d4015), VP9 |
| 144p | 256×144 | H.264 (avc1.4d400c), VP9 |

**Response Structure**:
```json
{
  "streamingData": {
    "adaptiveFormats": [
      {
        "itag": 137,
        "mimeType": "video/mp4; codecs=\"avc1.640028\"",
        "bitrate": 2173100,
        "width": 1920,
        "height": 1080,
        "quality": "hd1080",
        "qualityLabel": "1080p",
        "fps": 30,
        "url": "https://..."
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Future Implementation Path**:
1. Inject JavaScript into WebView to access player API
2. Use `player.setPlaybackQuality()` or similar YouTube player methods
3. Or: Parse available qualities and let WebView auto-select

---

### Related Content / Video Alternatives (Future Enhancement)

The `next` endpoint returns a Related tab that can find song/video counterparts.

> ⚠️ **Not Implemented**: Could be used to find video version of audio-only tracks or vice versa.

**Related Tab browseId Pattern**: `MPTRt_{trackId}`

**Example**: For song `DyDfgMOUjCI`, the Related tab browseId is `MPTRt_5OAD9vk2OaS`

**Page Type**: `MUSIC_PAGE_TYPE_TRACK_RELATED`

**Use Cases**:
- "Watch Video" button for ATV tracks that have an OMV version
- "Listen to Audio" for users who prefer audio-only playback
- Finding alternative versions (live, remix, etc.)

## Verification Summary

The following endpoints were tested without authentication on 2024-12-21. `FEmusic_library_corpus_track_artists` was re-validated on 2026-03-24:

### ✅ Working Without Auth

| Endpoint | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| `FEmusic_home` | HTTP 200 | Full response |
| `FEmusic_explore` | HTTP 200 | Full response |
| `FEmusic_charts` | HTTP 200 | Full response |
| `FEmusic_moods_and_genres` | HTTP 200 | Full response |
| `FEmusic_new_releases` | HTTP 200 | Full response |
| `FEmusic_podcasts` | HTTP 200 | Full response |
| `FEmusic_library_landing` | HTTP 200 | Returns login prompt (no content) |
| `FEmusic_library_corpus_track_artists` | HTTP 200 | Returns sign-in prompt (no artist rows) |
| `player` | HTTP 200 | Full metadata + streaming info |
| `music/get_queue` | HTTP 200 | Full queue data |
| `search` | HTTP 200 | Full results |

### ⚠️ Works with Session Cookies (from visiting music.youtube.com)

| Endpoint | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| `FEmusic_liked_playlists` | HTTP 200 | Works with session cookies |
| `FEmusic_liked_videos` | HTTP 200 | Works with session cookies |
| `FEmusic_history` | HTTP 200 | Returns login prompt without full auth |

### 🔐 Requires Full Authentication (SAPISIDHASH)

| Endpoint | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| `FEmusic_history` | HTTP 200* | Returns content with full auth, login prompt without |
| `FEmusic_library_corpus_track_artists` | HTTP 200* | Returns library artist rows with full auth, sign-in prompt without |
| `FEmusic_library_albums` | HTTP 400 | Needs auth + specific `params` value |
| `FEmusic_library_artists` | HTTP 400 | Rejected as invalid argument in current authenticated sessions |
| `FEmusic_library_corpus_artists` | HTTP 200* | Returns followed artists with full auth and public `UC...` browseIds |
| `FEmusic_library_songs` | HTTP 400 | Needs auth + specific `params` value |
| `FEmusic_recently_played` | HTTP 400 | Needs auth |
| `playlist/get_add_to_playlist` | HTTP 401 | Needs full auth; app caches with `APICache.TTL.library` |
| `playlist/create` | HTTP 401 | Needs full auth; response playlist ID may be top-level or nested |
| `browse/edit_playlist` | HTTP 401 | Needs full auth; app uses `ACTION_ADD_VIDEO` for adding tracks |
| `playlist/delete` | HTTP 401 | Needs full auth and user-owned playlist |

> **Note on Library Artists endpoints**: `FEmusic_library_corpus_track_artists` is the sign-in-backed Artists chip browseId and returns `MPLAUC...` library artist pages. Those `MPLAUC...` pages also require authentication when browsed directly. In current authenticated sessions, the library chip also exposes `FEmusic_library_corpus_artists` with `params=ggMCCAU=`; that endpoint returns followed artists with public `UC...` browseIds and is a better source for navigation. By contrast, `FEmusic_library_artists` currently returns HTTP 400 invalid argument even with full SAPISIDHASH authentication.
